Dependencies:
=============

* Pygame
* spim

You probably should be running this on a unix system. the spim command
line doesn't exist in Windows.


How it works:
=============

Spim doesn't have graphics support, random number support, or direct
keyboard input support, so we're using Python as a wrapper. Python
starts up spim as a subprocess and then manages its STDIN and STDOUT
for communcation


How to run it
=============

$ python boardinterpreter.py
